In C#, an `enum` is a value type that provides a readable representation of integer values.


üìå Basic Enum Example
```c#
enum Permission
{
    None,
    Read,
    Update,
    Delete,
    Create
}
```
Instead of using raw integers like `0`, `1`, `2`, etc., we use meaningful names like `Read` and `Delete`, which improves readability and maintainability.

By default, enums in C# are backed by `int`, but you can change the underlying type to something smaller (like `short` or `byte`) to optimize memory usage:

```c#
enum Permission : short { ... }
enum Permission : byte { ... }
```

## Custom Enum Values
You can assign custom values to enum members:
```c#
enum Permission
{
    None = 5,
    Read,        // 6
    Update = 10,
    Delete = 15,
    Create = 22
}
```
The values auto-increment unless explicitly assigned. In the example above, `Read` is automatically assigned `6`.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Combining Enum Values ‚Äî The Problem

You can define a variable of your enum like this:
```c#
Permission p1 = Permission.Read;
```
But if you try to add multiple permissions, like this:
```c#
p1 += Permission.Delete; // ‚ùå Compiler error
```
It fails ‚Äî because enums don‚Äôt support the `+` or `+=` operators by default.

## ‚úÖ Solution: Bit Flags
To combine enum values, we can use bitwise operations. 

| Permission | Binary      | Value |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| None       | 0000 0000   | 0     |
| Read       | 0000 0001   | 1     |
| Update     | 0000 0010   | 2     |
| Delete     | 0000 0100   | 4     |
| Create     | 0000 1000   | 8     |

To combine `Read` and `Delete`, we use the bitwise OR operator (`|`):
```c#
Permission p = Permission.Read | Permission.Delete;
```
To add another permission later (e.g., `Update`):
```c#
p |= Permission.Update;
```

But the value of `p` will show a number (e.g., `7`) instead of something readable.

---

This is where the `Flags` attribute comes in to fix that.
The `Flags` attribute allows you to treat an enum as a set of bit fields, enabling you to combine multiple values using bitwise operations.

```c#
[Flags]
enum Permission : byte
{
    None = 0,
    Read = 1,
    Update = 2,
    Delete = 4,
    Create = 8
}
```
Now, when you print the value:
```c#
Console.WriteLine(p); // Output: Read, Delete, Update
```
